# Get Started Tutorial: Support ink in your UWP app

This is the complete sample code for the [Get Started Tutorial: Support ink in your UWP app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/ink-walkthrough) on [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows).

With Windows Ink, you can provide your customers with the digital equivalent of almost any pen and paper experience imaginable, from quick handwritten notes and annotations to whiteboard demos to architectural and engineering drawings to personal masterpieces.

In this topic, we step through how to create a basic UWP app that supports writing and drawing with Windows Ink. 

We focus on the following:

* Adding basic ink support
* Adding an ink toolbar
* Supporting handwriting recognition
* Supporting basic shape recognition
* Saving and loading ink

For more detail on implementing these features, see our [Pen interactions and Windows Ink in UWP apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/pen-and-stylus-interactions) topics)
